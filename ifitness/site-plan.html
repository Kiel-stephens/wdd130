        We have designed classes to meet your fitness needs, and each class is capped at 20 people so everyone can get the individual 
        attention they need. All classes are first-come, first-served, so please show up 10-15 minutes early. If a 
        class gets full, you may have to register for a private session at a slightly more cost. Whichever class type you
        attend is tailored to meet your body goals.
